<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Adventures . . .</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a.- </font><font FACE="Arial"><b>The High Jungle</b> . . . a hidden
paradise on the slopes of the Andes, east of Huancayo. A unique experience in a place
surrounded by waterfalls, wild vegetation and the mystery of the cloud forest. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a hut with basic facilities - no electricity, out in the middle
of nowhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This very simple hut is my father's home. You will spend a few days in
this place, which will be a base for our walks, some climbing - you'll get totally wet and
still enjoy it! I promise.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b.- <b>Huaytapallana . . . .</b>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A visit to this holy mountain, to experience a bit of the life of our
Andean people. A variety of options from a one day trek to six days are available. It is
also possible to get porters and llamas to carry your packs, in order to enjoy a bit more
the beautiful landscape.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c.-<b>Esoteric Journeys</b> . . . A special trip only for very special
people in search of meaning and fulfilment. Huaytapallana is a very sacred place, but to
channel the good energy of this place we get help from a very special couple. I can
testify to the effect on my own life.... Sorry, special conditions apply to take this
trip. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d.- <b>Biking Trips</b> . . . You can bike from village to village as
we have many trails and back roads, but we also have some trips involving camping and a
very special one covering the three geografical regions of Peru over 14 days.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One very popular trip is a one day trek to the mountains with the down
hills on full suspension mountain bikes.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mantaro Valley by car . . . for those with limited time this option
covers a circuit of the craft villages, historical places and the best spots for fun and
eating traditional food.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We often go for fun on walks and treks around the Valley - you've just
got to be lucky arriving at Casa de la Abuela and join us for a walk, for this walks
everyone is welcome paying their own local transportation about $0.50 USD per way.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Party time. . . We have so many parties that often we get our students
together with other fellow travellers to go to local fiestas. The party starts at midnight
plus one second with fireworks, so we have to get there at the right time. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see from this summary, you might be entering a very special
experiance in your life. Peru is full of beautiful places, some very well known, some just
for those who want to get off the beaten trail. You are welcome in Huancayo, a place in
the heart of Peru, with a vibrant culture and friendly people.</p>
